Typing write ANLG1. 0.5 causes a bad data update to be sent

Features
=================================

Airdata plugin.  This plugin would calculate things like TAS, wind direction
Density altitude etc.  It would also be a good example of a plugin that used
only the callback mechanism instead of needing a thread.

Allow daemonization of the program.

Add commands to start/stop/restart plugins.  Might also add configuration to
load and/or start the plugin.  It could be loaded but not started.  Testing,
simulation and GUI plugins might not always start.

Add annunciation backend.

Maybe a feature to allow plugins to override a value.  It might be helpful for
some kinds of testing to allow the gui or command interface to override a
particular item so that the real hardware updates are stored but not actually
returned to other plugins or call callbacks.  It would have to be globally
tracked, able to be removed and indicated in the status for sure.

Does it make sense to track which plugin is writing to any particular database
item and flag when multiple plugins attempt to write to the same item.  Or
perhaps we have an item ownership system?  It'll probably work okay in the real
systems because it'll make sense, but it might be hard to troubleshoot issues
later if there are conflicts.

Add a sys path parameter to the configuration so the user can add a module
search path to the system for third party plugins.

The --config-file command line argument should allow for a single file name to
be given and the normal search for the filename to be carried out and the
config_path stored accordingly.  This would allow for different configurations
to be stored in the normal place and run with fixgw --config-file test.yaml

Client

  Reconnect and disconnect don't work properly
  Initialize Aux data on startup of the database.
  Show aux data on table in GUI.
  Add Tree view for status on GUI
  Add trending capability on GUI
  Setting an Aux Value to None from the client doesn't work.



GUI Plugin

  Move to client


CAN-FIX Plugin

  Add mandatory Node Specific Message responses
  Add node status information.


=================================
Testing
=================================

Further testing of the CAN-FIX plugin

Test plugin interface.

Test database failures.

Figure out a way to test the netfix protocol

Test all the error codes in netfix protocol for each command

Figure out a way to test the client and client module


=================================
Documentation
=================================

Document and netfix error codes and specify them generally

Document using the netfix client package fixgw.netfix

Document annunciate plugin
