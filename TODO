Add status tracking and display.  Probably have a status dictionary for each
plugin and then add a mechanism to get text or data associated with that
for display in the command module or a gui module.  Perhaps even a way to
indicate some alarms for some of it.

Add some tags to indicate some status information so that EFIS displays and
other equipment can have access to that.

DATABASE LOCKING!!!  Multithreaded app / single database??? Duh??!!

Finsh FlightGear Plugin.  Need to add conversion functions.  Finish the
XML file to try and get most of the data.  Also need to set the input
protocol up so that we can write to FlightGear

Add composite data points.  Things like Min, Max, Sum, Average, Span etc.
Could be used for things like summing the total fuel on board or determining
the Average EGT.

Airdata plugin.  This plugin would calculate things like TAS, wind direction
Density altitude etc.  It would also be a good example of a plugin that used
only the callback mechanism instead of needing a thread.



Allow daemonization of the program.

GUI Plugin?  Maybe a separate program? Maybe both?
