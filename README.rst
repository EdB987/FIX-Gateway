FIX stands for Flight Information eXchange.  It is a set of specifications,
protocols and documentation that is helps users exchange flight related
information easily and reliably.

Fix Gateway is a program that abstracts this flight information and allows
communication between different technologies.

The primary use is as the interface to the pyEfis electronic flight information
project. It can also be used to interface flight simulator software to 'real'
hardware such as instrumentation or custom flight controls.
