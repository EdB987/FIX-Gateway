# This file contains all of the mappings that tell the canfix plugin how
# to talk to the FIX Gateway database.  This is a YAML file.

# Input mappings are for data that is read from the CAN-FIX bus and written into
# the FixGW database.  This list contains the following information...

# CANID - The CAN-FIX ID of the parameter represented by the received message
# Index - The CAN-FIX index of the parameter
# FIX DB ID - The FIX Database ID (This should match an individual point
#             in the database configuration)
# Priority - The redundancy priority of this point 0 = primary, 1 secondary, etc.
inputs:
  # [CANID, Index, FIX DB ID, Priority]
